# My .vimrc
I work in Linux terminals via ChromeOS/crouton and Vim pretty often, so having my .vimrc in version control saves me the occasional headache.

### Installing Custom Colors
  1. Navigate to ~/.vim
  2. Locate or create colors/
  3. Put the color file in colors/ 
  4. Add the line `colorscheme newcolor` to your .vimrc or type `:colorscheme newcolor` during a Vim session.
